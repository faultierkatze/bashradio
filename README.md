# bashradio
simple command line web radio player

depends on *mpv* for playback, but other players such as mplayer could also be easily used by changing two lines of code - maybe there'll be some option to choose a player in the future

stations are saved as plain-text files in ./stations, containing one URL per file (the file name doubles as the station name displayed)

the stations provided in this repo are -unsurprisingly- ones that I like to listen to myself, serving as examples - there's no deeper meaning to the selection
